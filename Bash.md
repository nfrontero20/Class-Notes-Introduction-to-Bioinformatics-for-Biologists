### Test

```
this is code that I am going to run 
```

`echo`: 

* `-e`: recognizes escape characters.  

`sleep`: pauses for the number of seconds that you indicate in the sleep command.  Ex. `sleep 2`.  There is a 2 second pause after the time when someone puts the information and you display their answer.

`test` command and `[[]]` are interchangeable (I think):

`test -d code` tests if a directory exists

`if [[ -d code ]];then echo "directory exists";fi`
